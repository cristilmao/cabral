RO: Cabral este un bot facut la misto, totusi cu niste functii misto. Limbajul folosit este DISCORDJS. Token-ul bot-ului se afla in config.json. 
**IMPORTANT**: Din cauza copyright-ului, nu am putut face open-source comanda "cabral baga muzica" :(. Daca va uitati prin js, o sa gasiti comanda pusa. Trebuie uploadate fisierele .mp3. 
EN: Cabral is a romanian based bot. It was created jf4, nothing else. Language used: DISCORDJS. The bot's token is located in the config.json file. 
**IMPORTANT**: Unfortunately I am not able to upload the .mp3 files to github due to copyright. You can take a look in the js file, you will see what files you need. 
# Licience
